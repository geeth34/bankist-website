## Functionalities

Following significantly improve web performance :
- Smooth-scrolling : enhances the user experience by creating a visually appealing transition when navigating between the different sections.
- Lazy-loading : the sections and images load only on scroll, reducing initial load time.
- Sticky navigation-bar : keeps the links to different sections accessible without requiring the user to scroll back to the top of the page.
- Sign up window : allows users to register a new account to access the application.
